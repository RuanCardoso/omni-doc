One of the main advantages is that it provides a high level of control over the networking infrastructure, allowing developers to optimize their networking code for maximum performance. Additionally, Omni provides a number of features that are not typically found in other multiplayer frameworks, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Built-in ORM: Omni comes with a built-in ORM similar to Entity Framework, which supports a wide range of databases, such as MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle, Firebird, and others. Forget about PHP or any other backend language, do everything from your own game server, incredible, right? </li> <li>Decoupling: Omni allows you to decouple your game servers from other services like databases, authentication servers, and even game clients, allowing you to work with the design of Micro-Services, for example, you can have the database server independent from your game server and deploy it in a different server from your game server.</li> <li>Message Serialization: Omni supports message serialization using extremely efficient serializers like MemoryPack and MessagePack, and also supports communication via JSON for ease of use. Also, it offers message compression capabilities, which can significantly reduce the amount of data being sent over the network, resulting in faster data transfer and lower network bandwidth usage.</li> <li>Transport providers: Omni supports a wide range of transport providers out of the box, such as TCP, UDP, WebSocket, and it comes bundled with some providers that have multiple layers, like Reliable, Unreliable, ReliableEncrypted, etc. The encryption is top-notch and securely implemented using AES and RSA, providing a highly secure and efficient solution for your multiplayer game's security needs.</li> <li>Any type of data: Omni can serialize any type of data, such as classes, structs, lists, dictionaries, primitives, etc., making it a versatile tool for any kind of application that requires data serialization.</li> <li>Web Server: Omni comes with an embedded web server based on nginx, allowing you to create RESTful APIs, webhooks, and web applications directly from your game server, without the need to create a separate web server or deploy a backend application.</li> <li>Routing: Omni comes with a routing system similar to Express.js for Node.js, allowing you to create RESTful APIs, webhooks, and web applications directly from your game server.</li> <li>Additionally, Omni has many other features and capabilities that make it a powerful tool for any multiplayer game developer, such as support for RPC, NetVars, Web Sockets, Unity WebGL, Streamlined HTTP Handling, Port Forwarding, etc... allowing you to create high-quality, responsive, and scalable multiplayer experiences.</li> </ul> <p>These features, along with its high performance and flexibility, make Omni a powerful choice for any multiplayer game developer looking to create a high-quality, responsive, and scalable multiplayer experience.</p> <p>Hire me, my email is cardoso.ruan050322@gmail.com</p>"},{"location":"Getting%20Started/installation/","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"Getting%20Started/installation/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Install necessary dependencies before starting your project.</p> <pre><code>com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json\n</code></pre> <p>How to install newtonsoft-json?</p> <ol> <li>Open the Unity Editor.</li> <li>Go to <code>Window &gt; Package Manager</code>.</li> <li>Click on the <code>+</code> button in the top-left corner of the Package Manager window.</li> <li>Press <code>Add package by name</code>.</li> <li>Enter <code>com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json</code> as the package name and press <code>Add</code> or <code>Enter</code>.</li> <li>Wait for the installation to complete.</li> </ol> <p>Note</p> <p>Before installing check if the package is already installed. some versions of Unity include the package <code>com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json</code> by default.
